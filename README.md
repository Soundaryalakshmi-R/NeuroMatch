# NeuroMatch
NeuroMatch is a Python-implemented machine learning project that employs a Siamese Neural Network architecture to classify ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) based on EEG (electroencephalogram) data. This project utilizes the power of deep learning to process EEG signals and predict ADHD
